/* Commands to be executed:- */

Step 1: Create a large dummy file on a Linux system using fallocate command, you can also use dd command for this purpose
fallocate -l 10G test.txt
dd if=/dev/zero of=test.txt bs=1 count=1 seek=10M

Step 2: Check the filesystem usage percentage using AWK, something like below.
df -h |grep -v "File"|awk '{print $1" "$5}'|cut -d"%" -f1|awk '{if ($2 >=35) print $1 " Filesystem is full!"; else print $1 " Filesystem is very normal!";}'
